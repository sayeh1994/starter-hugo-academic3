A Ph.D. candidate in computer vision at the GIPSA laboratory in France, I am currently working on my thesis on AI explainability. I graduated from Grenoble INP university in signal and image processing. As part of my graduation thesis, I focused on generating facial expression recognition for model enhancement. Prior to my master's program, I had two years of professional experience in image processing. For more information, please see my resume.
